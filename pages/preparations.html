				<p style = "color: #ffffff">Qatar has made many steps into preparing for this World Cup. One of the key steps to this preparation is developing the Qatari national team. This has been planned out for over a decade from now, as the Qatari government contributed a lot of money towards creating new high-quality academies, the most notable one being Aspire Academy. Through this academy, the majority if not all the current players who play for the Qatari national team have majorly developed through this academy. Also, the currentr manager of the national tema Felix Sanchez was previously managing in Aspire. Sanchez has managed all these players who currently play for the national team and has contributed lots into the development of these players. Later on, Felix Sanchez has managed Qatar Under-17, Under-20 and then eventually moved up the ranks to become the manager of the first team after great success and results with the youth Qatari national teams.</p>
				<p style = "color: #ffffff">Another key step towards the preparation to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup was the vast improvement of infrastructure throughout the country. This includes all the new stadiums that were built for this tournament in multiple cities around the nation, all the public transportation developed throughout the cities, and generally speaking the tourism attraction throughout the country. Qatar was previously seen as just a small gulf nation that had very little tourism and infrastructure and recognition worldwide to having modern skyscrapers and buildings around the country, especially in the capital Doha, which people compare to one of the most widely known cities around the world, Dubai in the United Arab Emirates.</p>
				<p style = "color: #ffffff">Another vital source of preparation to this World Cup was the marketing and media recognition towards the tournament as a whole, with a great amount of Middle Eastern and North African famous players and sport personnel constantly promoting the event, as well as very famous soccer players around the world representing as World Cup Ambassadors, with some notable names such as David Beckham, Zinedine Zidane, and so on. Also, with a popular arabic sports channel around the world Bein Sports constantly promoting the World Cup in Qatar through advertisements and other ways of promoting the event through the widely known sports channel worldwide. </p>
				<p style = "color: #ffffff">Overall, Qatar has put immense efforts through the Qatari Football Association, as well as the Qatari government as a whole to set up and fully prepare for this widely viewed event worldwide.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><hr/>
