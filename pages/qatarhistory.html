				<p style = "color: #ffffff">Qatar's soccer history is one of the downsides of the national team. The Qatari national team has failed to make a World Cup ever since the foundation of the Qatari Football Association in 1960. However, there were several notable occassions where Qatar has came close to qualifying for the FIFA World Cup before 2022. One of these cases was in the 1990 World Cup Qualification, where Qatar reached the final qualifying round, where they placed 3rd in their group 1 point behind the United Arab Emirates, who qualified for the 1990 FIFA World Cup for the first time in their history. Another case was in the 1998 qualifiers, where Qatar finished 4th in their group with only 2 points behind Iran, who made the AFC World Cup Playoffs. One other case was in 2010 World Cup qualifiers, where Qatar were 4 points off of Bahrain, who made the AFC Playoffs in 2010 for their first time.</p>
				<p style = "color: #ffffff">Qatar's history leading up to this World Cup looks better int the AFC Asian Cup, the biggest tournament in Asia. In the 2011 Asian Cup which was hosted by Qatar themselves, Qatar made it to the quarter finals of the tournament, only losing 3-2 to the eventual champions Japan. In the 2019 Asian Cup which was in the United Arab Emirates, Qatar made a historical run by winning their group, and defeating the likes of Iraq in the Round of 16, South Korea in the quarter finals, UAE in the semi finals by winning by a shocking 4-0 win in UAE's home soil. Qatar then qualified to the Asian Cup final for the very first time in their history, and which they faced Japan. To complete their historic run, Qatar defeated Japan 3-1 to be crowned champions of Asia for the very first time.</p><br>
