				<dd><p style  =" color: #ffffff"> The 2018 FIFA World Cup that was held in Russia was the very last edition of the tournament that was played before the next edition hosted in Qatar. This tournament was widely known to be one of the most dramatic versions, with many matches experiencing last minute goals and surprises to many supporters. The hosts Russia were drawn in a group with Uruguay, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia in the same group. In their first match, Russia were against one of the strongest Asian teams at the time Saudi Arabia, which ended in a whopping 5-0 win for Russia. Russia went ahead to defeat Egypt and their star Mohamed Salah, however were brushed aside by a strong Uruguay team 3-0 at their home soil. Arguably one of the biggest surprising results in this World Cup was Russia's Round of 16 win against a very strong Spanish team, with hosts Russia winning in penalties after a 1-1 draw after extra time.</dd></p> 
				<dd><p style  =" color: #ffffff"> However, the most well known surprise in this edition of the tournament has to be the previous World Champions Germany getting a very early exit in their group at the very bottom of their group. This group had the likes of South Korea, Sweden, Mexico and Germany. Germany were able to defeat Sweden thanks to Toni Kroos and his mind-blowing free kick in the very last minutes of the match, in which the match ended in a 2-1 victory for the Germans. Germany went on to lose against Mexico in a 1-0 bitter defeat. However, the most shocking result for Germany was against South Korea, which they lost 2-0 and went through a complete disaster, to then exit the tournament very disappointedly.</dd></p>
				<dd><p style  =" color: #ffffff"> As for the remaining parts of the tournament, notable results to mention in this edition of the FIFA World Cup are the following: France 4-3 Argentina in the Round of 16 in an outstanding matchup, Belgium's 3-2 win over Japan after completing a comeback from being 2-0 down, an intense matchup between Belgium and Brazil in the quarter finals with Beligum getting a crucial 2-1 win, Croatia's 2-1 victory over England after extra time in the semi finals to send the Croatians to the final in a historical amazing World Cup run. And then we reach the final with France being matched up against an amazing and in-form Croatia squad. The match ended in a surprisingly and unusual 4-2 win for France. Historically, World Cup finals are usually seen as a very defensive and tight matchups between the two finalists, with the previous 3 World Cup finals before going to extra time and all the way to penalties in 2006 between France and Italy, in which Italy were crowned champions. However, the 2018 final was a completely different type of final, with a toral of 6 goals scored throughout the match.</dd></p> 
				
				<p style  =" color: #ffffff"><b> 2014 World Cup Brazil</b></p><hr> 
				<dd><p style  =" color: #ffffff"> This edition of the FIFA World Cup in Brazil was a special one for many viewers around the world. This edition in Brazil was filled with drama, passion, and controversial moments. With the hosts being Brazil, the tournament had a lot of culture for the sport as Brazil has always been widely known to be one of the best football national teams in the world and arguably the most successful in history, having won the most World Cup titles with 5 titles on separate occassions. This tournament experienced several underdog stories, especially with the likes of Algeria and the most well known 2014 World Cup underdog, Costa Rica. The 2014 FIFA World Cup kicked off with an own goal by the Brazilian left back Marcelo against Croatia. The Brazilians were down 1-0 at the opening match, however, they were able to make a comeback to eventually win 3-1 in their first match on their own home soil. The first group, which included the hosts Brazil, saw the likes of Brazil, Croatia. Mexico, and Cameroon. Brazil were definitely the favourites to win the group, with Mexico and Croatia to battle it out for the second place. The group eventually saw Brazil fulfilling the expecations and finishing first in the group with 2 wins and a draw against Mexico, with the Mexican goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa having a spectacular and historical night for his nation. This match ended in a 1-1 draw, and Mexico were in second place right after Brazil with 7 points as well.</dd></p> 
				<dd><p style  =" color: #ffffff"> In the group stage, some notable and dramatic events occurred. The most notable events and moments started off with a <i>shocking defeat for the defending champions of the 2010 FIFA World Cup for Spain</i>, as the European giants losing 5-1 to a spectacular Netherlands, with the most notable goal coming from a diving header of Robin van Persie which soon became famous around the world. Spain then went to lose 2-0 to Chile in a very disappointing start from Spain, which resulted in an early exit for the Spaniards on a shocking campaign. Spain ended the group with a third place finish. The next surprise was the likes of <i>Costa Rica </i>defeating a very strong South American side of Uruguay 3-1, which is a result that nobody expected at all, even the Costa Ricans themselves. Costa Rica then went on to defeat an even stronger and historical team in the FIFA World Cup, Italy. The match ended 1-0 with the only goal coming from the Costa Rican midfielder Bryan Ruiz in the 44th minute. Costa Rica then shocked the world as they drew 0-0 to England on the last matchday of the group and coming out on top of the hardest and strongest group in the entire tournament, with Uruguay, England, and Italy in the same group as Costa Rica. The group ended with Costa Rica finishing first and Uruguay second, and with Italy and England making a shocking early exit, as both teams expecting to make it out of this group.</dd></p> 
				<dd><p style  =" color: #ffffff"> In the knockout stage, we have another underdog story. Algeria managed to qualify as second place in a group with the likes of Belgium, Russia, and South Korea in the same group. Algeria then had a very difficult and challenging opponent to face in the Round of 16. They came across the eventual world champions, Germany. What was impressing of this match is that Algeria were able to defend very well and draw 1-1 with Germany, forcing the match to go into extra time and then eventually Germany were able to win 2-1 after extra time. Costa Rica were matched up against Greece, in which they were able to defeat in penalties, sending Costa Rica to the quarter finals. Another notable match was the Netherlands against Mexico, which ended in a 2-1 victory for the Dutch. However, the score was 1-1 until the very last minute, where Robben was taken down in the penalty box, giving a penalty to the Dutch. This specific moment was a very frustrating one for Mexican supporters, since they believed that a penalty wasn't supposed to be given, and then Robben dived to receive a penalty for Netherlands.</dd></p>
				<dd><p style  =" color: #ffffff"> In the quarter finals, Costa Rica were matched up against Netherlands, which experienced a fascinating contest that ended in a 0-0 draw leading to another penalty shootout. However, this is when the underdog story for Costa Rica ends, as they get defeated 4-3 in penalties by the Dutch. In the semi finals, Netherlands and Argentina also drew 0-0 and went all the way to penalties, in which Argentina were able to win, and reach the final. In the other semi final match, a humiliating match was waiting to happen between the hosts Brazil and Germany. The match was the most popular and widespread around the globe at the time, with Brazil suffering a heavy 7-1 defeat to the Germans. We then reach the final, with Germany facing Argentina in Rio de Janeiro. An amazing final where Messi and Argentina were looking forward to complete their run, and Germany were also looking forward to defeat the Argentines to be crowned as world champions. The match remained 0-0- until extra time, where Mario Gotze scored the winning goal for Germany, as they win 1-0 and are crowned as world champions, which finishes one of the most popular versions of the World Cup in history.</dd></p>

				<dd><p style  =" color: #ffffff"><b> 2010 World Cup South Africa</b></dd></p><hr> 
				<dd><p style  =" color: #ffffff"> In the 2010 FIFA World Cup, which is the first time an african nation has hosted the tournament in history as South Africa hosted the tournament, there were also plenty of historical and dramatic moments that occurred throughout the tournament. In the group stage, Group A, which had South Africa, France, Mexico and Uruguay, had some surprising results for many. The first surprise is France's 2-0 loss against Mexico. France is known to be one of the strongest national teams in the world, as they were finalists for the previous ediiton in Germany, where they lost to Italy on penalties. This France side in particular looked completely different than the one 4 years ago, as they also drew 0-0 vs Uruguay and they also lost 2-1 to the hosts South Africa on a very disappointing World Cup campaign to be forgotten for France. Another huge shock was Italy's very poor performance in Group F, with a group alongsides New Zealand, Slovakia and Paraguay. Many were shocked by Italy placing last in the group, as they were the defending champions of the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany 4 years earlier.</dd></p>
				<dd><p style  =" color: #ffffff"> As we move on to the knockout stage of this tournament, some notable events to mention are Germany's 4-1 win against England in the Round of 16, as England suffered a heavy loss to the Germans, and they also got a clear goal to many disallowed from Frank Lampard. Germany also went on to defeat Argentina 4-0 in the quarter finals, but then lost against Spain 1-0 in the semi finals. A great underdog run by Ghana was also an interesting one in this edition of the World Cup, as they reach the quarter finals after defeating USA after extra time, only to lose against Uruguay in penalties after a controversial moment by Luis Suarez, as he handballed the ball to prevent it from going in, and as a reuslt he received a red card. What was unfortunate is that because of Suarez's actions, Ghana missed the penalty and so missed their chances to defeat Uruguay in order to make the semi finals.</dd></p>
				<dd><p style  =" color: #ffffff"> Eventually, we reach the final with Netherlands against Spain in the heart of South Africa, with Netherlands looking to finally win a final for their first time ever in their FIFA World Cup history. Spain on the other side looked very strong with a lot of quality players in their squad and a great squad depth in the tournament. This final was a very intense one with both teams unable to score a goal for the entire 90 minutes, which resulted in the match having to go to extra time, ands in the last few minutes, Iniesta scored a famous volley to secure the victory for Spain in a memorable and historical run.</dd></p>
