				<p style = "color: #ffffff">Possibly one of the more mentioned topics of Qatar hosting is the controversy behind the host bid for this World Cup. At the highest levels of government, there were claims of corruption, vote-swapping, and connections to trade agreements. FIFA exonerated Qatar of wrongdoing, but as recently as 2020, US prosecutors charged three former senior FIFA officials with accepting payments in exchange for casting a vote in Qatar's favour.Although there has never been any evidence of misconduct, many observers have questioned the validity of the election due to its peculiar results. In 2014, stadium building got underway. Since then, there have been 37 additional off-site deaths in addition to three "work related deaths" on actual stadium construction sites. The figure is proportionate to the size of the provided foreign labour, according to Qatari officials. Human rights advocates assert that there are a great number more mysterious fatalities. The main problem has been the quality of living. The "appalling living circumstances" for workers were condemned by Amnesty International, which claimed they were on the verge of "modern slavery." According to the organisation, migrant labourers from Bangladesh, India, and Nepal were sometimes deceived about their pay and other working conditions, such as their freedom to leave the work camp or stadium. Coca-Cola, McDonald's, Adidas, and AB InBev all released statements in response to the situation endorsing immigration reforms and Qatari worker compensation. All have continued to support the competition, nevertheless, as sponsors. All of the debates have widened the scope of the conversation on climate change. Even some players have faced backlash for their participation in the tournament. For instance, Gary Neville, a former England defender, has come under fire for agreeing to commentate the World Cup for a TV network controlled by Qatar. FIFA stirred anger by telling teams to "concentrate on football" rather than becoming "dragged into every ideological or political conflict" in an effort to calm down players (and spectators) who might be confused about the politics at play. With so much going on beneath the surface of Qatar's 2022 World Cup, it might be difficult for viewers to "concentrate on football" exclusively.</p>
